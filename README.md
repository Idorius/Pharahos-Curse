#The Twelve Hours of the Night

###Genre: Narrative-driven action roguelite
###Theme: Egyptian mythology, initiatory journey, redemption
###Concept: The shattered soul of a cursed priest journeys through the 12 realms of the Egyptian afterlife in a quest to reclaim his lost unity.

Dive into the afterlife of Ancient Egypt. Confront your inner demons. Find your balance… or vanish forever.
In a bold fusion of tactical roguelite gameplay and deep mythological storytelling, play as Neferhotep, a cursed priest whose soul has been torn in two. Simultaneously control your Ka, a raw and instinctive force, and your Ba, an ethereal and strategic spirit, in a desperate quest to traverse the 12 realms of the underworld and reclaim your lost unity.

##THE SHATTERED SOUL: A UNIQUE MECHANIC
Your curse is your greatest tool.
The Ka strikes hard and smashes through obstacles, while the Ba uses stealth and magic as its main skills.. But their fates are bound together: neglecting one in favor of the other will doom you. Their fragile balance is the key to survival—and will determine the nature of the judgment that awaits you at the end of your journey.

##THE TWELVE HOURS, TWELVE UNIQUE REALMS
Travel through biomes as breathtaking as they are deadly, each reflecting a fragment of your past and your psyche:
Flee dissolution in the Abysses of Nun, the ocean of primordial chaos.
Endure judgment in the Hall of the Weighing of the Heart, where the devourer Ammit waits for the slightest imbalance.
Lose yourself in the Palace of Shattered Reflections, where your own shadows turn against you.
Each Hour is a distinct adventure with its own ecosystem of enemies, traps, and mysteries to unravel, culminating in an epic guardian boss.

##YOUR BALANCE DETERMINES YOUR FATE
The Duat is a merciless judge. Your journey culminates in the final sanctuary, where the very nature of your enemy depends on the state of your divided soul.
Have you fed your instinctive rage (Ka) too much? You will face Set himself—and certain defeat.
Have you scorned your body in favor of a cold, detached spirit (Ba)? The implacable judgment of Osiris will annihilate you.
Have you nurtured balance between your two halves? Then, and only then, will you confront the true enemy: the embodiment of your own inner conflict—for a chance at redemption.

##A LOOP WITH MEANING
Death is not an end, but a lesson. Each failure sends you back to the beginning, leaving behind memory fragments, permanent upgrades, and a deeper understanding of the Duat’s mysteries. Unlock new abilities, discover secret paths, and peel back the layers of a narrative that reveals your personal curse to be merely the symptom of a far greater cosmic fracture.

##KEY FEATURES
An Innovative Dual Combat System: Manage two characters with radically different abilities in real time.
12 Beautifully Nightmarish Worlds: Inspired by authentic Egyptian mythology, with a stylized, atmospheric low-poly art direction.

The Twelve Hours of the Night is more than a survival game in the afterlife.
It is an interactive meditation on what makes us whole.
Will you make peace with yourself, or succumb to the extremes of your own soul?
“The path to fusion lies not in defeating the other, but in understanding oneself.”
